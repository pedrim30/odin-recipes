    <p>They are very good and taste much better than store-bought English muffins. They're great with orange butter or cream cheese and jam.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>6 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ cup melted shortening</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup cornmeal, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Warm milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from heat. Stir in sugar until dissolved and let cool until lukewarm.</li>
        <li>Mix together warm water and yeast in a small bowl; let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine milk mixture, yeast mixture, 3 cups flour, and shortening in a large bowl; beat until smooth.
            Mix in salt and remaining 3 cups flour; knead until a soft dough forms.
            Place in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>Punch down dough. Roll on a lightly floured surface to about 1/2-inch thick.
            Cut rounds with a biscuit cutter, drinking glass, or empty tuna can.
            Sprinkle cornmeal on waxed paper and place dough rounds on top. Dust tops with cornmeal, cover, and let rise for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a greased griddle over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Cook muffins on griddle until lightly browned, about 10 minutes per side. Split and toast as desired.</li>
    </ol>
